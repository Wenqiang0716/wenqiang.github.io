I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by <a href='https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/jhc'>Prof. Hao Chen</a>. I graduated from Hong Kong Polytechnic University with a Master of Philosophy and a Bachelor's degree. I also obtained an MSc in Engineering Management degree from the City University of Hong Kong. My research interests currently focus on medical artificial intelligence, especially self-supervised learning, test-time adaptation, multi-modal modeling, and diffusion models.
